## ðŸ”— Course: IBM CC0201EN - Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift
---

## ðŸ”— Overview

This hands-on course guided me through the fundamentals and practical applications of **containerization**, **orchestration**, and **cloud-native development** using Docker, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift. Each week built on the previous one, giving me both conceptual understanding and the chance to apply my skills in real cloud environments.

## ðŸ”— What I Learned

### ðŸ”— Week 1: Understanding the Benefits of Containers

I started by learning what containers are and how they differ from virtual machines. I explored the features and benefits of containers, how Docker works, and how to use Dockerfiles to create container images. I practiced building a container, running it, and pushing it to a registry.

**Key Concepts:**

* Docker CLI basics
* Image vs container
* Dockerfile instructions
* Working with container registries

### ðŸ”— Week 2: Understanding Kubernetes Architecture

In the second week, I discovered how **Kubernetes** orchestrates containers. I explored Kubernetes architecture including control planes and nodes, and worked with key objects like Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments. I used `kubectl` to interact with a cluster.

**Key Concepts:**

* Kubernetes cluster architecture
* Core objects: Pods, Deployments
* kubectl command usage
* Imperative vs declarative approaches

### ðŸ”— Week 3: Managing Applications with Kubernetes

Here, I learned how to manage apps running in Kubernetes. I used ReplicaSets for scaling, applied autoscaling rules, and conducted rolling updates. I also learned to keep configuration and secrets separate from application code using ConfigMaps and Secrets.

**Key Concepts:**

* Dynamic autoscaling
* Rolling updates and rollback
* Managing app configuration and secrets
* Service binding

### ðŸ”— Week 4: The Kubernetes Ecosystem

This module introduced me to the wider Kubernetes ecosystem. I explored **Red Hat OpenShift**, its differences from Kubernetes, and learned about build automation with BuildConfigs and triggers. I also discovered how Operators and Istio enhance Kubernetes capabilities.

**Key Concepts:**

* OpenShift architecture and CLI (`oc`)
* Build strategies and image streams
* Operators and service mesh (Istio)
* CNCF ecosystem overview

### ðŸ”— Week 5: Final Assignment â€“ Guestbook App Deployment

In the final project, I applied everything by building and deploying a multi-tier Guestbook application on OpenShift. I integrated IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, used Git-based builds, and implemented autoscaling. This practical project brought all the concepts together.

**Project Highlights:**

* Containerized app deployment
* GitOps-style source-to-image builds
* App autoscaling
* External service binding

## ðŸ”— Skills I Gained

* Docker container creation and image management
* Kubernetes object and cluster management
* App deployment and scaling strategies
* OpenShift CI/CD automation and CLI usage
